## **💡 Initial Idea & Thought Process**  
The idea was to create a **simple yet powerful task manager** that supports:  
✔️ **Collaborative task management** (mentions & tagging)  
✔️ **User-friendly experience** with a minimalistic UI  
✔️ **Scalability & performance optimization** with proper backend handling  
✔️ **Data security & efficient session handling**
- still all things not added what I planned due  to time constraints but 
- mentioned user can get info another notification and view where, who mentioned, also tags them and 
- on task, multiple users can add notes on live  board like 
- Notification about tasks as per the priority base using Firebase cloud messaging, SMS, or other notifications with configuration.
- 

While time constraints limited adding **real-time updates **, the core features were built to ensure a smooth and productive workflow.
